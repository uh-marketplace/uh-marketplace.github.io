## Overview

UH Marketplace is a UH Manoa-exclusive online marketplace designed for students and faculty to buy, sell, and trade items like textbooks, furniture, electronics, clothes, and more. This app fosters sustainability, convenience, and campus connection by allowing only UH-verified users to post and explore listings.

Unlike general platforms like Facebook Marketplace, UH Marketplace prioritizes **security, simplicity, and community**‚Äîevery user is authenticated with a `@hawaii.edu` email, and all transactions are arranged outside the app after users connect through in-app messaging.

---

## Deployment

[UH Marketplace]() <!-- add link to deployed application in parethesis -->will be deployed using **Vercel**, ensuring fast and reliable delivery of the app. Our project codebase is maintained in GitHub and built using Next.js and Bootstrap 5.

GitHub Pages will be used to host this homepage (`uh-marketplace.github.io`) with updates about the platform and progress.

## Milestones

### [M1 Project](https://github.com/orgs/uh-marketplace/projects/6)

For Milestone 1 we focused on the visuals of our project to get our skeleton of the project up and running. Completing our landing page, mockup pages, and deploying our application to Vercel were the most important issues we had to complete for milestone 1.

## [M2 Project](https://github.com/orgs/uh-marketplace/projects/7)

For Milestone 2 we focused on core functionality by integrating the database and implementing key user features. Creating the Explore, Favorites, Profile, and Messages pages, enabling users to read and write data, and setting up Playwright tests and CI on GitHub Actions were the most important issues we had to complete for milestone 2.

## [M3 Project](https://github.com/orgs/uh-marketplace/projects/8/views/1?layout=board)

For Milestone 3, we focused on enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of our application as we approached the final stages of the project. This included refining existing features, addressing bugs, and optimizing performance to ensure a seamless experience for our users. We gathered and integrated real data into our database, allowing us to validate the system's functionality with realistic scenarios and improve its reliability. These efforts brought us closer to delivering a polished and fully functional product.

## Development

First, [install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Then create a database for your application.

```

$ createdb nextjs-application-template
Password:
$

```

Second, go to [https://github.com/uh-marketplace/uh-marketplace-app](https://github.com/uh-marketplace/uh-marketplace-app), and click the "Code" button. You can either clone the repo thru Github Desktop or with git clone to download the repo to your local file system.

Third, cd into the directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```

$ npm install

```

Fifth, create a `.env` file from the `sample.env`. Set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to match your PostgreSQL database that you created in the first step. See the Prisma docs [Connect your database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases/connect-your-database-typescript-postgresql). Then run the Prisma migration `npx prisma migrate dev` to set up the PostgreSQL tables.

```

$ npx prisma migrate dev
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "<your database name>", schema "public" at "localhost:5432"

Applying migration `20240708195109_init`

The following migration(s) have been applied:

migrations/
‚îî‚îÄ 20240708195109_init/
‚îî‚îÄ migration.sql

Your database is now in sync with your schema.

‚úî Generated Prisma Client (v5.16.1) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 51ms

$

```

Then seed the database with the `/config/settings.development.json` data using `npx prisma db seed`.

```

$ npx prisma db seed
Environment variables loaded from .env
Running seed command `ts-node --compiler-options {"module":"CommonJS"} prisma/seed.ts` ...

üå± Seeding complete

üå±  The seed command has been executed.

```

### Running the system

Once the libraries are installed and the database seeded, you can run the application by invoking the "dev" script:

```

$ npm run dev

> nextjs-application-template-1@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.2.4

- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env

‚úì Starting...
‚úì Ready in 1619ms

```

### Viewing the running app

If all goes well, the template application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can login using the credentials in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/uh-marketplace/uh-marketplace-app/blob/main/config/settings.development.json), or else register a new account.

### ESLint

You can verify that the code obeys our coding standards by running ESLint over the code in the src/ directory with:

```
$ npm run lint

> nextjs-application-template-1@0.1.0 lint
> next lint

‚úî No ESLint warnings or errors
$
```

## Community Feedback

Quang: Good: "Easy to use UI Bad: Needs to have more options for the user like for example, add like a credibility feature so people don‚Äôt get scammed."

Donnie: "The UI is really clean and easy to navigate. I dont like how it sends you to the add a product page after you register, i think it should send u to the home page. I like how theres a search bar and a favorites page but a small thing is when u look at someones profile all their listings are marked as favorited idk if that was intentional. Another small thing is i think clicking on the picture should also open up the little window
but overall very nice."

Kendric: "Interface is nice, easy to naviagte good colorway, but when adding an item personally, the containers are too close in the profile section."
